# Frontend Engineer Test

This repository contains the implementation of a mini Unsplash clone, following the instructions for the Cowrywise frontend engineer test. The project uses Vue.js and demonstrates proficiency with various frontend technologies such as Vue component lifecycle management, API integration, CSS grid, and SCSS.

## Project Overview
The project leverages the Unsplash API to fetch and display photos in a staggered grid layout. Users can search for specific images via the search bar, with the search being triggered by either pressing the Enter key or clicking on the search icon.

## Features

- **Image Search:** Users can search for specific images by entering keywords. Search can be triggered by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the search icon.
- **Random Image:** Fetching: A set of random images is displayed when the page loads, fetched from the Unsplash API.
- **Modal View:** Clicking an image opens a modal showing the image in higher resolution.
- **Loading Placeholder:** A skeleton loader is displayed while images are being fetched from the API.
- **Overlay & Text:** Each image has a text overlay showing the author’s name and location with a tint applied to ensure legibility.


## Tech Stack

- **NUXT.JS:** Used for building the frontend interface.
- **SCSS:** CSS preprocessor used for more structured and maintainable styles.
- **Unsplash API:** Provides the images for the gallery.
