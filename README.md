# Frontend Engineer Test

This project is part of an assignment for a frontend engineering test at Cowrywise. The objective is to create a mini Unsplash clone using Vue.js and the Unsplash API. The gallery dynamically loads images based on search criteria or random selection, with each image displaying the author’s name and location.

## Features

- **Image Search:** Users can search for specific images by entering keywords. Search can be triggered by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the search icon.
- **Random Image:** Fetching: A set of random images is displayed when the page loads, fetched from the Unsplash API.
- **Modal View:** Clicking an image opens a modal showing the image in higher resolution.
- **Loading Placeholder:** A skeleton loader is displayed while images are being fetched from the API.
- **Overlay & Text:** Each image has a text overlay showing the author’s name and location with a tint applied to ensure legibility.


## Tech Stack

- **NUXT.JS:** Used for building the frontend interface.
- **VANILLA CSS:** Used for styling the components and layout.
- **Unsplash API:** Provides the images for the gallery.
- **Axios:** Used to handle API calls and fetch image data.
